    <p>
        In medicine, an outbreak request refers to the
        notification or alert made to healthcare authorities
        or organizations regarding the occurrence of an outbreak of a
        particular disease or infection.
    </p>

    <p>
        Outbreak requests are typically made when there is evidence of a sudden increase in the number of cases of a specific disease within a defined population or geographical area.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is a formal request
        to initiate an investigation, implement control measures,
        and coordinate response efforts to contain
        and mitigate the spread of the disease.
    </p>

    <p>
        The purpose of an outbreak request is
        to gather resources and expertise to identify the cause,
        assess the extent and severity of the outbreak, implement appropriate control measures,
        and prevent further transmission of the disease. This involves collaboration between healthcare providers, public health agencies, laboratories, and other relevant stakeholders.
