    <h3>Nutrition</h3>
    <p>
        As you enter the 7th month of pregnancy, your baby's development continues. Focus on maintaining a healthy diet for both you and your baby's well-being:

        <li>Ensure a diet rich in calcium, as your baby's bones continue to grow.</li>
        <li>Consume foods high in fiber to support digestion and reduce constipation.</li>
        <li>Incorporate iron-rich foods to prevent anemia.</li>
        <li>Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water to avoid dehydration.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Exercises</h3>
    <p>
        Staying active in the 7th month is essential for your health and preparing for labor. Consider these safe exercises for pregnant women:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Continue low-impact aerobic exercises like walking or swimming for cardiovascular health.</li>
        <li>Prenatal yoga and stretching exercises can help with flexibility and relaxation.</li>
        <li>Kegel exercises to strengthen pelvic floor muscles are beneficial for labor and delivery.</li>
    </ul>
